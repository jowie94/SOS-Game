# SOS-Game
A simple SOS (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOS_(game)) game implementation in Haskell for the Programming Languages (LP) subject in the Computer Science degree at FIB (UPC)

## How to play
- Introduce the number of rows and columns.
- Select the game mode.
- When asked, enter the row, column and letter to put in the game table.

## TODOs
If I have time in the future here's a list of changes I'd like to introduce (among others)
- Player vs Player mode.
- Show the game table each time the Machine makes a movement.
- Better AI.
